Ok, I had way too much fun creating the quiz app.

My girlfriend is always making me take those facebook quizzes so I decided
to turn the tables on her and give her a quiz about something important.....me !

I was planning on having the quiz show all the correct answers at the end, but
ended up giving it to my family to play with before I had implemented that part.
That was the best thing I could have done. They spent over an hour playing with
the app, first trying to outdo each other's score, and then working together to
try to get a perfect score. It was amazing watching them thoroughly enjoy
something that I had created.

I think the ultimate goal of software should be to help people accomplish or
enjoy something without getting in the way and watching my family enjoying my
app, I have to say I was pretty successful.

I spent a lot of time searching and reading how to do new things on Android.
Whenever I thought of something cool to add to it, I would start googling how to
do it. I think once you have the basics down for a language/platform, this is a
great next step.


Oh, and the pic is a pic of me and my best bud, Darwin, up at Ski Bowl a few
years ago.


Some cool features I figured out:

- Dynamically expand and collapse Views based on user actions. This was my initial
“wouldn't it be cool if” idea when I started thinking of the app and it really drove
the overall design. Seemed like a great feature for making efficient use of limited
mobile screen real-estate.

- Add music...I'm still looking for a better way to switch music tracks other than
destroying and recreating my media player.

- Add funny question answers with funny little Easter eggs....toasts, images that
expand, music that starts playing

- Shade buttons to let the player know which questions they have answered.

- Switching the layout displayed on the screen

- Check correct state before going to next layout...did user enter their name, did
they answer all questions?

- A leader board that tracks the top 5 scores for this execution of the app – would
be cool to learn file I/O and write the leader board to persistent store.

- Text shadowing

- use runnables and handlers to start a thread for animating flashing text
