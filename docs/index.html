		<p class="side-text">Ok, I had way too much fun creating the quiz app.<br/><br/>

		My girlfriend is always making me take those facebook quizzes so I decided</br>
		to turn the tables on her and give her a quiz about something important.....me !<br/><br/>

		I was planning on having the quiz show all the correct answers at the end, but<br/>
		ended up giving it to my family to play with before I had implemented that part.<br/>
		That was the best thing I could have done.  They spent over an hour playing with<br/>
		the app, first trying to outdo each other's score, and then working together to<br/>
		try to get a perfect score.  It was amazing watching them thoroughly enjoy<br/>
		something that I had created.<br/><br/>

		I think the ultimate goal of software should be to help people accomplish or<br/>
		enjoy something without getting in the way and watching my family enjoying my<br/>
		app, I have to say I was pretty successful.<br/><br/>

		I spent a lot of time searching and reading how to do new things on Android.<br/>
		Whenever I thought of something cool to add to it, I would start googling how to<br/>
		do it.  I think once you have the basics down for a language/platform, this is a<br/>
		great next step.<br/><br/><br/>
		Oh, and the pic is a pic of me and my best bud, Darwin, up at Ski Bowl a few<br/>
		years ago.<br/><br/>

		<p class="side-text">Some cool features I figured out:<br/></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Dynamically expand and collapse Views based on user actions.  This was my initial</br>
			“wouldn't it be cool if” idea when I started thinking of the app and it really drove<br/>
			the overall design.  Seemed like a great feature for making efficient use of limited<br/>
			mobile screen real-estate.</li>
			<li>Add music...I'm still looking for a better way to switch music tracks other than<br/>
			destroying and recreating my media player.</li>
			<li>Add funny question answers with funny little Easter eggs....toasts, images that<br/>
			expand, music that starts playing</li>
			<li>Shade buttons to let the player know which questions they have answered.</li>
			<li>Switching the layout displayed on the screen</li>
			<li>Check correct state before going to next layout...did user enter their name, did<br/>
			they answer all questions?</li>
			<li>A leader board that tracks the top 5 scores for this execution of the app – would</br>
			be cool to learn file I/O and write the leader board to persistent store.</li>
			<li>Text shadowing</li>
			<li>use runnables and handlers to start a thread for animating flashing text</li>
		</ul>
